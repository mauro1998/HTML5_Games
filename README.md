# 2D Phaser-Webpack-ES6 Boilerplate

This is a small webpack-compatible boilerplate project to quickly start development of games in ES6 using Phaser framework ([v3](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html)). This structure is based on several open-source projects found on Github.

## Installation

- Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:VictoryProductions/2d-phaser-webpack-boilerplate.git` - (SSH Method)
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Build

Just run `npm run dev` and webpack will bundle the source files and serve them within a `dist/` folder and launch a local server in `localhost:3000`, webpack will also watch for changes made to any of the files and automatically reload the page to reflect the changes.

**Note:** Production build is still under development.

## Final steps

Enjoy and start coding :)
